# NLIE-UNet
Dynamic Neighborhood-Enhanced UNet with Interwoven Fusion for Medical lmage Segmentation.
## Introduction
While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly UNet and its variants, have demonstrated excellent performance, they face challenges such as insufficient adaptive capability, redundant feature information, and weak multi-scale feature sensing. To address these issues, we propose a novel medical image segmentation method called Dynamic Neighborhood-Enhanced UNet with Interwoven Fusion (NLIE-UNet).Our approach includes a Cyclic Dynamic Convolution Block (CDCB) to adaptively capture edge contour information, a Neighborhood Enhanced Bridge (NEB) to exploit the consistency and complementarity of different layer features, and a Hierarchical Interwoven Fusion Module (HIFM) to fuse cross-layer information effectively. Extensive experiments on five public medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
